  summary: Wrappers for the “CoreServices” framework on macOS.
  description: |
    The PyObjC project aims to provide a bridge between the Python and
    Objective-C programming languages on macOS. The bridge is intended to be
    fully bidirectional, allowing the Python programmer to take full advantage
    of the power provided by various Objective-C based toolkits and the
    Objective-C programmer transparent access to Python based functionality.
